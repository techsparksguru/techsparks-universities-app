# Why
- `Search Time`: As a tech startup we wanted to reach out to educational institutions across India to demo our product and also provide training to fresh graduates and so on. We first reached out the universities from which each of us came from, but soon realized that the addressable space is significantly larger. We started typing "universities in Telangana", "universities in Maharashtra" and so on. But those search(s) lacked completeness of reach
- `Type`: Some call it university, some call it academy, some others call it school and some others institution :) Soon we realized that to even search, we need to have a generic term that represents all...lets just say "educational institutions" (this is the most generic word for us in hindsight when conversing). Once again we needed structure in using the right keywords (For the data guys, you can relate this problem of that of meta data)
- `Collaborate & Scale`: As we involved Marketing & Sales teams (which consisted lots of interns from various parts of the country), their first question was "Can you provide me the list of all educational institutions with email, phone and address?"
- And the list goes on...
